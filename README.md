## About the Video Course
Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming. Python’s elegant syntax and dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms.

This video course is about leveraging the Python programming language and its thriving ecosystem to save yourself time and money when doing common routine tasks. Nobody wants to do boring and time-consuming tasks: days have 24 hours and you should squeeze out the most of this time for yourself - automating the boring tasks gives you back time to focus on what you really like to do. Moreover, this is also the chance for you to learn a great general-purpose language such as Python, with which you can build very cool applications both at work and in your spare time.
The course is structured as an incremental learning path: you will start with a deep-dive into Python software development basics, then move on to write scripts to automate file system operations and file contents processing on your local host, then you will learn how to interact with web-based services such as websites and APIs in order to robotize the cool things that we do everyday - such as tweeting, posting to social networks, reading RSS feeds, etc. - moreover you will practice how to set up a web-based services yourself in the form of web applications and in the end you will learn how to analyze and visualize datasets in order to extract knowledge.
By the end of this course you will have learned how to proficiently write structured Python code in a wide range of applications – from one-liner scripts to complex web applications – aiming at the automation of lots of common everyday life tasks.
